CAPTURED: Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible's Killer,2c1e5720-38bd-11ec-ae1e-07ae769f5070,2018-05-14 13:36:00+00:00,"In April of 2018, we were all talking about the capture of the Gold State Killer but did you know another long-time cold case was solved that same week? On December 29, 1999, best friends Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were having a sleepover at Ashley's house. Sometime in the early morning hours of December 30th, Ashley's parents were murdered and their home set on fire. The two girls were never seen again. For years, theories surrounded this case. Did Someone take the girls? Were the girls responsible for one or more murders and then ran off to start new lives? Well in 2018 we finally got answers, though, as of this recording their remains have still not been found.
